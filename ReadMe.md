- Visualise DNA sequences in the browser.
- Edit existing DNA sequence and create new ones.
- Fetch DNA sequnces from the NCBI database directly into the app for visualisation and editing.
- Add meta data to the sequences, ie, feature annotations. This includes primer sequences, genes, promoters, etc.
